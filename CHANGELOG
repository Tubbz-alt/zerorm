This code may not be thread safe, that hasn't been thorougly tested.

Sorry it's not that well documented. Hopefully the readability and simplicity make up for that

There's only runtime exceptions, and not too many of them. Typically they occur only when it is
known that the compiled SQL would throw an exception if it was executed. One exception being 
that you aren't allowed to "DELETE FROM TableName" without unprotected the Delete statement.
The other cases are "bind time" exceptions:
- When Selecting from another Select statement, the other statement must have a non-empty alias
- When joining a table, the select statement of the join walks through the join expression.
    If it finds that a Column with a non-null parent isn't defined in FROM or JOIN parts,
    it throws an exception.
- Type safe parameter binding
- A few other cases (check the code)

There are some unit tests. There should be more. I have other tests which exercise the library 
more that I typically run, but still, more unit tests are needed.

I have used the Select class in code quite a bit. Not so much the Insert, Update, Delete.
Proceed with extra caution for these.
